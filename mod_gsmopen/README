GSMOPEN channel for Mobigater or Huawei devices

In order to use the gsmopen channel:

1. The module has to be placed in the folder
/usr/lib/freeswitch/mod/

2. Configuration file needs to change under
/opt/freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs/

It is possible to swap the channels by unloading the old channel

and then load the alternative channel once the .so library and configuration 
are in place
