Sekowei security edition has arrived! The six release of Freedom Fone.

Freedom Fone is an open source vCMS. A vCMS is a Voice Content Management that
allows you to deliver and receive audio content via the GSM network or a SIP
voice over IP gateway. The software connects phone networks to our platform,
two flexible voice applications allow the retrieval of audience feedback (Leave
a Message) and to deliver customized audio content (IVRs).

Freedom Fone is the result of four years of field experience with telephony 
information services for civil society. During the development of telephony 
services for small organizations, we quickly discovered that there was enough 
technology to build almost anything but voice remained difficult to use. 

With Freedom Fone we have tried to provide basic but yet powerful voice services
that allows bi-direcctional communication by the phone and that it is why we 
want to describe Freedom Fone as a voice Content Management System (vCMS). 

With Freedom Fone, (mobile) phone users can leave audio messages and navigate 
audio content using their phone. System administrators can later on classify
the audio feedback received and  build new content.  

Rather than presenting users with a million options to set up a telephony system,
we have opted to design basic but powerful telephony applications that can be used 
with a great degree of flexibility. 

We have put special emphasis in the user interface and lowering the cost of 
interfacing with the GSM network. 

Freedom Fone is built thanks to the power of several open source projects: 
FreeSWITCH, Spidermonkey, PHP5, Cake PHP MVC and Jquery. 
For those that want to automate the creation of audio we have included support for 
Cepstral, a text-to-speech voice engine capable of synthesizing voice messages. 

Freedom Fone has been mostly tested using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

What is new in 2.S?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Enhanced Security

2.S includes Roll Based Access Control (RBAC) and separates the Administrator
roles from a normal User of the system that has access to the audio content
If you want to know more about what each of the roles can do, check out our
RBAC documentation that describes what the Admin and Normal User can and can
not do.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Updated Graphical Interface

The Graphical User Interface has been updated to the latest version of
Cake PHP MVC

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

New filesystem and secure storage

We have re-arranged all the filesystem structure of Freedom Fone to allow
the protection of sensitive/personal identifiable information.

2.S allows the possibility to encrypt all the audio received, including the log
files in a new secure storage.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sweeping sensitive data

2.S allows the dynamic sweeping of sensitive data as phone numbers of the callers
A backend sweeper allows the possibility of removing meta tags from MP3 and WAV
files.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

New build system

Installation of Freedom Fone can be performed in 10 simple steps and most of the 
complexity of building the backend has been removed by providing pre-compiled
packages for our customized FreeSWITCH installation.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Remote hosting on the Cloud

Freedom Fone can be installed on the Cloud. Freedom Fone enhanced architecture
supports the possibility of having the backend virtualized on a Cloud solution
and still be present with local GSM numbers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Freedom Fone Appliance. A turn-key solution

In early 2012, Freedom Fone can be ordered in an appliance as a turn-key 
solution.
